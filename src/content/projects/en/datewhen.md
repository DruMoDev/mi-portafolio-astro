## Project Description

**DateWhen** is a comprehensive Shopify application designed to solve a critical e-commerce challenge: allowing customers to choose exactly when they receive their orders. Built with a clean architecture (DDD + Hexagonal) and modern technology stack, this app provides a seamless user experience for both shoppers and merchants.

The application integrates deeply into the Shopify ecosystem using Metafields to store configurations, avoiding unnecessary external databases for store settings, ensuring speed and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Calendar Widget**: Intuitive date picker on cart and product pages.
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents checkout if a valid date is not selected when required.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Define lead times, blocked days (holidays), and cutoff times.
- **Time Slots**: Support for morning, afternoon, or custom delivery intervals.
- **Product Rules**: Advanced configuration for products requiring different preparation times.
- **Robust Architecture**: Node.js backend with TypeScript and React frontend using Shopify Polaris.
